## üéØ What We Built

High-performance data processing platform for Germany's largest energy company. Our team migrated legacy Java monolith to NestJS microservices architecture with focus on efficient CSV export generation from complex MongoDB aggregations using streaming patterns.

**Key Features:**
- Streaming CSV exports for large energy market datasets
- Complex MongoDB aggregation pipelines for market analysis
- Microservices architecture with NestJS framework
- Real-time data processing with event-driven patterns
- Auto-scaling export workers for peak demand periods

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

**Backend:** NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Redis, Node.js Streams

**Microservices:** Distributed across AWS ECS and Lambda functions

**Data Processing:** MongoDB aggregation pipelines, streaming transforms

**Infrastructure:** AWS ECS, Application Load Balancer, ElastiCache, DocumentDB

## üîß Microservices Design

### Service Architecture
Our team built modular NestJS services with clear separation of concerns:

- **Query Service:** Handles complex energy market data queries and filtering
- **Export Service:** Manages CSV generation with streaming for memory efficiency
- **Data Processing Service:** Real-time market data ingestion and transformation
- **User Management Service:** Authentication and role-based access control
- **Analytics Service:** Query performance tracking and usage metrics

### Streaming CSV Export System
**Challenge:** Legacy system took 45+ minutes to export large datasets, causing memory issues and timeouts.

**Solution:** We implemented Node.js Transform streams with MongoDB cursor-based pagination:
- **Memory Efficient:** Process data in chunks without loading entire datasets
- **Scalable:** Handle exports from 1MB to 10GB+ without performance degradation  
- **Resumable:** Export jobs can be paused and resumed using checkpoint patterns our team developed
- **Concurrent:** Multiple export workers process different data segments simultaneously

### MongoDB Aggregation Optimization
Our team designed complex aggregation pipelines for energy market analysis:
- **Pipeline Stages:** Match, group, project, and sort operations optimized for indexes
- **Memory Management:** Used allowDiskUse for large aggregations exceeding RAM limits
- **Index Strategy:** Compound indexes designed specifically for common query patterns we identified
- **Cursor Batching:** Configurable batch sizes based on document complexity and memory constraints

### NestJS Service Communication
**Inter-Service Messaging:** We used Redis pub/sub for real-time updates and SQS for reliable async processing
**Dependency Injection:** Leveraged NestJS DI container for clean service boundaries and testability
**Guards & Interceptors:** Custom authentication guards and logging interceptors across all services
**Exception Handling:** Centralized error handling with custom exception filters our team implemented

### Lambda Integration for Peak Processing
**Serverless Workers:** We implemented AWS Lambda functions for burst processing during peak export periods
**Event-Driven Scaling:** Lambda functions triggered by SQS messages when ECS capacity reaches limits
**Cost Optimization:** Serverless architecture reduces costs during low-demand periods while maintaining performance
**Hybrid Architecture:** Seamless integration between ECS containers and Lambda functions for optimal resource utilization

## üìä Performance Improvements

- **Export Time:** Reduced from 45+ minutes to 12 minutes for large datasets
- **Memory Usage:** 90% reduction in peak memory consumption during exports
- **Concurrent Processing:** Support for 50+ simultaneous export jobs
- **Query Performance:** Optimized aggregation pipelines with proper indexing strategy
- **Serverless Scaling:** Lambda functions handle 200+ concurrent export requests during peak hours

## üöÄ Technical Challenges We Solved

### Memory-Efficient Data Streaming
Our team implemented Transform streams that process MongoDB cursors in configurable chunks, preventing memory overflow on large datasets while maintaining export speed.

### Complex Aggregation Pipeline Design
We built sophisticated MongoDB pipelines that join multiple collections, perform statistical calculations, and format data for energy market reporting requirements.

### Microservice Orchestration
Our team designed service communication patterns using NestJS modules where export requests trigger workflows across multiple services without tight coupling.

### Scalable Worker Architecture
We created auto-scaling export workers using AWS ECS that spin up based on queue depth and processing time metrics, ensuring consistent performance during peak usage.

### Lambda Cold Start Optimization
Our team implemented connection pooling and provisioned concurrency for critical Lambda functions, reducing response times during burst processing scenarios.

### Error Recovery & Resilience
We implemented circuit breaker patterns and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling MongoDB connection issues and temporary service unavailability.
