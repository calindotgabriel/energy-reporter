## üéØ What We Built

High-performance data processing platform for Germany's largest energy company. Our team migrated legacy Java monolith to NestJS microservices architecture with focus on efficient CSV export generation from complex MongoDB aggregations using streaming patterns.

**Key Features:**
- Streaming CSV exports for large energy market datasets
- Complex MongoDB aggregation pipelines for market analysis
- Microservices architecture with NestJS framework
- Real-time data processing with event-driven patterns
- Auto-scaling export workers for peak demand periods

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

**Backend:** NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Redis, Node.js Streams

**Microservices:** Distributed across Azure Container Instances and Azure Functions

**Data Processing:** MongoDB aggregation pipelines, streaming transforms

**Infrastructure:** Azure Container Instances, Application Gateway, Azure Cache for Redis, Azure Cosmos DB

## üîß Microservices Design

### Service Architecture
Our team built modular NestJS services with clear separation of concerns:

- **Query Service:** Handles complex energy market data queries and filtering
- **Export Service:** Manages CSV generation with streaming for memory efficiency
- **Data Processing Service:** Real-time market data ingestion and transformation
- **User Management Service:** Authentication and role-based access control
- **Analytics Service:** Query performance tracking and usage metrics

### NestJS Framework Selection
I had significant leverage in selecting NestJS as our primary framework due to its:
- **Dependency Injection:** Built-in IoC container that simplified service management and testing
- **Testing Capabilities:** Comprehensive testing utilities with mocking and dependency injection support
- **TypeScript Integration:** Native TypeScript support that improved code quality and developer experience
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns that aligned with our microservices approach

### Streaming CSV Export System
**Challenge:** Legacy system took 45+ minutes to export large datasets, causing memory issues and timeouts.

**Solution:** We implemented Node.js Transform streams with MongoDB cursor-based pagination:
- **Memory Efficient:** Process data in chunks without loading entire datasets
- **Scalable:** Handle exports from 1MB to 10GB+ without performance degradation  
- **Resumable:** Export jobs can be paused and resumed using checkpoint patterns our team developed
- **Concurrent:** Multiple export workers process different data segments simultaneously

### MongoDB Aggregation Optimization
Our team designed complex aggregation pipelines for energy market analysis:
- **Pipeline Stages:** Match, group, project, and sort operations optimized for indexes
- **Memory Management:** Used allowDiskUse for large aggregations exceeding RAM limits
- **Index Strategy:** Compound indexes designed specifically for common query patterns we identified
- **Cursor Batching:** Configurable batch sizes based on document complexity and memory constraints

### NestJS Service Communication
**Inter-Service Messaging:** We used Azure Service Bus for reliable messaging and Redis for real-time updates
**Dependency Injection:** Leveraged NestJS DI container for clean service boundaries and comprehensive testability
**Guards & Interceptors:** Custom authentication guards and logging interceptors across all services
**Exception Handling:** Centralized error handling with custom exception filters our team implemented

### Azure Functions Integration for Peak Processing
**Serverless Workers:** We implemented Azure Functions for burst processing during peak export periods
**Event-Driven Scaling:** Functions triggered by Service Bus messages when Container Instances reach capacity limits
**Cost Optimization:** Serverless architecture reduces costs during low-demand periods while maintaining performance
**Hybrid Architecture:** Seamless integration between Container Instances and Azure Functions for optimal resource utilization

## üìä Performance Improvements

- **Export Time:** Reduced from 45+ minutes to 12 minutes for large datasets
- **Memory Usage:** Significant reduction in peak memory consumption during exports
- **Concurrent Processing:** Support for 50+ simultaneous export jobs
- **Query Performance:** Optimized aggregation pipelines with proper indexing strategy
- **Serverless Scaling:** Azure Functions handle 200+ concurrent export requests during peak hours

## üöÄ Technical Challenges We Solved

### Memory-Efficient Data Streaming
Our team implemented Transform streams that process MongoDB cursors in configurable chunks, preventing memory overflow on large datasets while maintaining export speed.

### Complex Aggregation Pipeline Design
We built sophisticated MongoDB pipelines that join multiple collections, perform statistical calculations, and format data for energy market reporting requirements.

### Microservice Orchestration
Our team designed service communication patterns using NestJS modules where export requests trigger workflows across multiple services without tight coupling.

### Scalable Worker Architecture
We created auto-scaling export workers using Azure Container Instances that spin up based on queue depth and processing time metrics, ensuring consistent performance during peak usage.

### Azure Functions Cold Start Optimization
Our team implemented connection pooling and pre-warmed instances for critical Azure Functions, reducing response times during burst processing scenarios.

### Error Recovery & Resilience
We implemented circuit breaker patterns and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling MongoDB connection issues and temporary service unavailability.
