## üéØ What I Built

High-performance data processing platform for Germany's largest energy company. Migrated legacy Java monolith to NestJS microservices architecture with focus on efficient CSV export generation from complex MongoDB aggregations using streaming patterns.

**Key Features:**
- Streaming CSV exports for large energy market datasets
- Complex MongoDB aggregation pipelines for market analysis
- Microservices architecture with NestJS framework
- Real-time data processing with event-driven patterns
- Auto-scaling export workers for peak demand periods

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

**Backend:** NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Redis, Node.js Streams

**Microservices:** Distributed across AWS ECS and Lambda functions

**Data Processing:** MongoDB aggregation pipelines, streaming transforms

**Infrastructure:** AWS ECS, Application Load Balancer, ElastiCache, DocumentDB

## üîß Microservices Design

### Service Architecture
Built modular NestJS services with clear separation of concerns:

- **Query Service:** Handles complex energy market data queries and filtering
- **Export Service:** Manages CSV generation with streaming for memory efficiency
- **Data Processing Service:** Real-time market data ingestion and transformation
- **User Management Service:** Authentication and role-based access control
- **Analytics Service:** Query performance tracking and usage metrics

### Streaming CSV Export System
**Challenge:** Legacy system took 45+ minutes to export large datasets, causing memory issues and timeouts.

**Solution:** Implemented Node.js Transform streams with MongoDB cursor-based pagination:
- **Memory Efficient:** Process data in chunks without loading entire datasets
- **Scalable:** Handle exports from 1MB to 10GB+ without performance degradation  
- **Resumable:** Export jobs can be paused and resumed using checkpoint patterns
- **Concurrent:** Multiple export workers process different data segments simultaneously

### MongoDB Aggregation Optimization
Designed complex aggregation pipelines for energy market analysis:
- **Pipeline Stages:** Match, group, project, and sort operations optimized for indexes
- **Memory Management:** Used allowDiskUse for large aggregations exceeding RAM limits
- **Index Strategy:** Compound indexes designed specifically for common query patterns
- **Cursor Batching:** Configurable batch sizes based on document complexity and memory constraints

### NestJS Service Communication
**Inter-Service Messaging:** Used Redis pub/sub for real-time updates and SQS for reliable async processing
**Dependency Injection:** Leveraged NestJS DI container for clean service boundaries and testability
**Guards & Interceptors:** Custom authentication guards and logging interceptors across all services
**Exception Handling:** Centralized error handling with custom exception filters

## üìä Performance Improvements

- **Export Time:** Reduced from 45+ minutes to 12 minutes for large datasets
- **Memory Usage:** 90% reduction in peak memory consumption during exports
- **Concurrent Processing:** Support for 50+ simultaneous export jobs
- **Query Performance:** Optimized aggregation pipelines with proper indexing strategy

## üöÄ Technical Challenges Solved

### Memory-Efficient Data Streaming
Implemented Transform streams that process MongoDB cursors in configurable chunks, preventing memory overflow on large datasets while maintaining export speed.

### Complex Aggregation Pipeline Design
Built sophisticated MongoDB pipelines that join multiple collections, perform statistical calculations, and format data for energy market reporting requirements.

### Microservice Orchestration
Designed service communication patterns using NestJS modules where export requests trigger workflows across multiple services without tight coupling.

### Scalable Worker Architecture
Created auto-scaling export workers using AWS ECS that spin up based on queue depth and processing time metrics, ensuring consistent performance during peak usage.

### Error Recovery & Resilience
Implemented circuit breaker patterns and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling MongoDB connection issues and temporary service unavailability.
